# Projectile Motion
### Numerical analysis of projectile motion
<br/>

In this project I analysed projectile motion with quadratic air drag, under windy conditions and also examined the Coriolis effect.
I used Python to obtain solutions numerically. The code is located in ```.py``` files and is for informative purposes only.
The report is located in the pdf file ```projectile-motion.pdf```.
